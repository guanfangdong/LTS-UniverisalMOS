# LTS: Learning Temporal Distribution and Spatial Correlation Towards Universal Moving Object Segmentation

## News 🎺🎺🎺
Due to my recent busy schedule, the plan to clean the code has been put on hold. Therefore, I intend to upload the code without cleaning it first. Due to differences in devices, I don't believe this code can run directly on your computer. Furthermore, the readability and structure of this code are very poor. However, if you are in urgent need to run the code, I can provide some assistance. I am eager to complete the cleaning of the code in the near future to make our code cleaner and more understandable.

## Introduction
This repository hosts the dataset and model files for the LTS (Learning Temporal Distribution and Spatial Correlation Towards Universal Moving Object Segmentation) approach, a novel method for moving object segmentation in videos using stationary cameras. Our method focuses on learning from diverse videos by capturing the similarities in temporal pixel distributions and refining segmentation through spatial correlation learning.

## Dataset
We proposed the LTS dataset, covering a wide range of natural scenes. These videos are instrumental in demonstrating the effectiveness and universality of our approach for moving object segmentation.

### Dataset Access
The dataset is split into multiple parts and is accessible via Google Drive. Here are the links to download the dataset:
- [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M3YsXmIBhsonYSMySTgI016kSXKwoV1j?usp=drive_link)

### Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized in compressed files for convenient download:
- `part1.tar.gz`
- `part2.tar.gz`
- `part3.zip`
- `part4.tar.gz`
- `part5.zip`
- `part6.zip`
- `raw_videos` directory containing all the raw video files.

After downloading, extract the files to access the video data.

## Model
We currently provide the trained LTS model file. At this stage, the model file is available for use, but please note that the accompanying inference and training code are still being cleaned up for release.

### Model File Structure
- `/models`: Contains the LTS model file.
